# About Franc1sco
Franc1sco sells overprice, poorly written code for around 25+ USD. He claims to be a "Veteran Sourcemod Coder" but still __Steals__ code off other users without mentioning them at all. 

__Feel free to download his "private" plugins above__

__So what do you get for $25+?__
- Bad support.
- Badly written plugins.
- False advertising.
- Adverts for Franc1sco on the $25+ plugin you just brought.
- Stolen code. (He has admitted to it.) [Proof](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/3719639cc55142a1b1330ea3207f865c926bf553/68747470733a2f2f692e6779617a6f2e636f6d2f32353761376630363537613234616364666637623639333139376666363164642e706e67)

# Replacements for Franc1sco's Plugins
- csgo.tokenstash.com he is 100% working with these guys, use [csgotokens](https://csgotokens.com), its cheaper, better support & more options (auto restart & more...)
- WS, Knife & Gloves. Well he stole most of his code from the public, regularly updated plugin created by kgns (nice guy btw). [Better WS & Knife](https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=298770), [Better Gloves](https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=299977)
- He tried to make his own steam invite bot at first, ended up stealing this code later on from [ASteambot Invite To Steam Group](https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=301755), also Arkarr is a really nice guy, helped me out a lot for free.
- If you really want to block users from using "sm plugins" [here](https://github.com/Bara/BlockSMPlugins) is a free plugin.
- Using [Core v2.x](https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=299311) with this [Module](https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=304501) does exactly what __Valve Competitive Rank (RankMe Edition & Stamm version)__ does.

```
Submit a issue on Github or email me to add another replacement.
```

# Franc1sco unethical business
- He claims all other plugins what provide a similar thing might give you viruses.
- All other plugins will result in a GSLT ban.
- He doesn't clearly state the ws plugin doesn't come with !knife. But after purchase the private repository clearly says "If you want a !knife plugin you need to use the private knife version, if you still dont have it, then buy it from me (Franc1sco franug)."
- Selling illegal plugins for profit would could result in his clients being taken to court. For example his __Multi adverts plugin__ breaks most MOTD advertisers terms of service.
- Telling clients to not include .sp files.

__Now this is shady__

:
i recommended use my plugin instead, more safe
```
After asking twice why his plugin is more safe I didn't get a single response what answered that question. This is clear evidence of Franc1sco abusing trust & people who don't understand the modding community in order to sell his plugins.

# Illegal / Unethical Plugins
* __Multi adverts plugin__: for use all the advertisement services like motgd, sourcerev, VPPGamingNetwork, etc in one plugin, increasing a lot the earnings. __(Note: Claim to be removed by Franc1sco after I mentioned it.)__
* __Block "sm plugins" commands__: for prevent that people can see the plugin list from your server. Include logging the client that try to use that commands, multi-language messege, inmmunity for root admins.
* __Weapon paints private version 6.x__: fix console spam errors, fixes, optimizations include weapon paint attached to his corresponding weapon,multi-language support for all the paints, always updated with the new paints, full support, and methods for prevent bans in your server and you can use it always.
* __Knife plugin 3.0__: Fix console spam errors, flag support for each knife, always updated with the new knives, full support, and methods for prevent bans in your server and you can use it always.
* __Valve Competitive Rank (Stamm version) plugin__ Adapted to the Stamm vip plugin. Always updated and support for prevent bans in your server. Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6XHoO3cE4Q
* __Valve Competitive Rank (RankMe Edition)__: Players are ranking by RankMe points, plugin easily configurable, include rank overlays (all the rankme versions supported).
* __Valve items menu__: A menu with all the valve items availables in your server (ws, knife, sprays, ranks, music, gloves). Check video here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I407YAmXRRI

- Never use Franc1sco, he will overcharge & give you poorly written code.

# Franc1sco Humanised
After exchanging some DMs between each other I feel it is worth adding this section ([Full Chat Logs](https://github.com/WardPearce/Franc1sco-Franug-Leaked-Plugins#full-dm-logs)).
He has helped out the sourcemod community over a numerous amount of years with releasing over 100+ plublic plugins, as seen [here](https://forums.alliedmods.net/member.php?u=94277).

__But__ this does not justify or exonerate his illegal and unethical activites.  

```
Franc1sco Franug [SM Coder] ❤❤
:
scammy not, unethical maybe (against valve, etc), i just do what people said me to do
scammers, haters, resellers, etc make me to lose a bit the ethical selling sourcemod stuff, and as i said i need a bit money for gasoil/stuff to finish my studies for get a real job and leave all of these
hope you understand
```

I understand his justification & can relate to it. But it doesn't justify his actions.

After alerting him that his __Multi adverts plugin__ breaks most MOTD advertisers terms of service he claimed he has halted from selling it, he did remove it from his [store](https://github.com/Franc1sco/Franug-PRIVATE-PLUGINS), but for I know he is still selling it. But if it turns out he isn't anymore then that does prove he does have some best interests at heart.

```
Franc1sco Franug [SM Coder] ❤❤
:
Selling illegal plugins for profit would could result in his clients being taken to court. For example his Multi adverts plugin breaks most MOTD advertisers terms of service. -Really? i dont think so, its GPL licenced plugins.
```
Just because the plugin is licenced under GPL doesn't mean its ethical to steal large amount of code without even mentioning the author, selling it privately & then writing your name over it.

you think that kgns is a good guy? the same guy that told me shit against me without known me well? https://forums.alliedmods.net/showpost.php?p=2530757&postcount=7 the same guy that say shit against others in in the forum? https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=298770 (hall of shame), why you say shit against me without talk with me before? why you see the work that i did (+100 plugins, continuisly i am helping people on the forum https://forums.alliedmods.net/member.php?u=94277 (see my messages, i made multiple messages helping people)
obviusly i tried to talk with kgns and told him nicelly that if i could remove the shit that he said but he dont want
so you are another person that want to hate something because yes?
you love to hate people?
no idea what happen to the people here on internet, i hope to retire soon of this shit
https://www.sourcemod.net/plugins.php?cat=0&mod=-1&title=&author=franc1sco&description=&search=1
you could post instead, and the messeges that i have on the forum helping people
but of course is more fun hate people
and of course you will hate me because as i said is more easy hate people and see only the bad part instead of understand him, and you don't care what i could say, right?
Franc1sco Franug [SM Coder] ❤❤
:
but anyway dont worry, i will retire soon of doing things for sourcemod
I'm tired of enduring scammers who resell my plugins, people who say shit about me without even talking to me before, and people who only see the bad and do not value all the work and help I've given, no idea how deal the youtubers with all the hate because here on internet exist so much hate for everybody, but of course surely they will get more money that me doing much less. For me is just enought to get enought money to pay the fuel in order to go for my programming classroom and finish my studies for get a real programmer job and leave the sourcemod stuff.
Franc1sco Franug [SM Coder] ❤❤
:
He claims all other plugins what provide a similar thing might give you viruses. -I dont have that, and i know that it was dump. But people what support to (help to install, information, etc) not just functionality.
All other plugins will result in a GSLT ban. -Really i have a plugin that block bans but i dont share it with everybody but as you know is very easy to leak plugins and waste the job of others, like you did it, surely that you dont want that for your own plugins but of course is more easy hate people instead of put on his place.
He doesn't clearly state the ws plugin doesn't come with !knife. But after purchase the private repository clearly says "If you want a !knife plugin you need to use the private knife version, if you still dont have it, then buy it from me (Franc1sco franug)." -I always say that i sell ws and knife separated, i dont lie with this.
Selling illegal plugins for profit would could result in his clients being taken to court. For example his Multi adverts plugin breaks most MOTD advertisers terms of service. -Really? i dont think so, its GPL licenced plugins.
Telling clients to not include .sp files. -I dont have that, and also some clients told me that the plugins that they have got leaked, and obviously they dont want that.



If you have some other question, just let me know, I am always open to talk even with people that did shit against me, and i know that my english is not good but i try to do my best and be the more nicely that i can.
if all of this is because you got a bad experience with me, let me know and we can see what we can do to solve it, but please, let the hate away, and we could talk as civilian persons

wait i am searching something more
also ptah extensions is required, in my plugin is optional and all is modular, also i remember some post where people say to kngs that he got ungry with bad replies to people that just reported log errors, i am searching it, i tell you when i found it
what more you have against me?

A. It does work when you have a knife (ik for a fact)
B. The ptah is optional for only the part you stole from kngs

Why do you have VAC bans on some of your accounts? Is not it so unethical? Maybe I did not make the best ethical decisions but I do not judge people
A. some people said that, maybe i am wrong, no idea
B. they said shit about me a long time before that i use atleast some of their code, even when i tried to talk to him, so I've only done what he wanted, right? Some people just resell plugins of other, no is that a worst action?
he*
and all the code is GPL so everybody can use it
also others people even dont share the source code and sell plugins without source, me not, i am try to be legal and for that reason i am not banned on alliedmods
so why you think that i am so evil?

Badly written plugins. -I am trying to do my best, also it works well and that was the more important thing for me, surely it could be better but i am not a professional coder yet, i am learning.
False advertising. -Exactly what you mean? and you know how to work the marketing in this world?
Adverts for Franc1sco on the $25+ plugin you just brought. -You can remove it, even people said me to remove it and i sent the plugin edited without it.
Stolen code. (He has admitted to it.) Proof -As i told you, i just said that (as joke) because i was ungry and he used it to say shit against me.
