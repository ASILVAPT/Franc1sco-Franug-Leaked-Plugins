# About Franc1sco
Franc1sco sells overprice, poorly written code for around 25+ USD. He claims to be a "Veteran Sourcemod Coder" but still __Steals__ code off other users without mentioning them at all. 

__Feel free to download his "private" plugins above__

__So what do you get for $25+?__
- Bad support.
- Badly written plugins.
- False advertising.
- Adverts for Franc1sco on the $25+ plugin you just brought.
- Stolen code. (He has admitted to it.) [Proof](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/3719639cc55142a1b1330ea3207f865c926bf553/68747470733a2f2f692e6779617a6f2e636f6d2f32353761376630363537613234616364666637623639333139376666363164642e706e67)

# Replacements for Franc1sco's Plugins
- csgo.tokenstash.com he is 100% working with these guys, use [csgotokens](https://csgotokens.com), its cheaper, better support & more options (auto restart & more...)
- WS, Knife & Gloves. Well he stole most of his code from the public, regularly updated plugin created by kgns (nice guy btw). [Better WS & Knife](https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=298770), [Better Gloves](https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=299977)
- He tried to make his own steam invite bot at first, ended up stealing this code later on from [Better Steam Invite](https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=301755), also Arkarr is a really nice guy, helped me out a lot for free.

Submit a issue on Github or email me to added another replacement.

# Franc1sco unethical business
- He claims all other plugins what provide a similar thing might give you viruses.
- All other plugins will result in a GSLT ban.
- He doesn't clearly state the ws plugin doesn't come with !knife. But after purchase the private repository clearly says "If you want a !knife plugin you need to use the private knife version, if you still dont have it, then buy it from me (Franc1sco franug)."
- Selling illegal plugins for profit would could result in his clients being taken to court. For example his __Multi adverts plugin__ breaks most MOTD advertisers terms of service.
- Telling clients to not include .sp files.

# Illegal / Unethical Plugins
* __Multi adverts plugin__: for use all the advertisement services like motgd, sourcerev, VPPGamingNetwork, etc in one plugin, increasing a lot the earnings.

* __Weapon paints private version 6.x__: fix console spam errors, fixes, optimizations include weapon paint attached to his corresponding weapon,multi-language support for all the paints, always updated with the new paints, full support, and methods for prevent bans in your server and you can use it always.
* __Knife plugin 3.0__: Fix console spam errors, flag support for each knife, always updated with the new knives, full support, and methods for prevent bans in your server and you can use it always.
* __Valve Competitive Rank (Stamm version) plugin__ Adapted to the Stamm vip plugin. Always updated and support for prevent bans in your server. Video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6XHoO3cE4Q
* __Valve Competitive Rank (RankMe Edition)__: Players are ranking by RankMe points, plugin easily configurable, include rank overlays (all the rankme versions supported).
