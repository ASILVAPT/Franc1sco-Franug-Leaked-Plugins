# About Franc1sco
Franc1sco sells overprice, poorly written code for around 25+ USD. He claims to be a "Veteran Sourcemod Coder" but still __Steals__ code off other users without mentioning them at all. 

__Feel free to download his "private" plugins above__

__So what do you get for $25+?__
- Bad support.
- Badly written plugins.
- False advertising.
- Adverts for Franc1sco on the $25+ plugin you just brought.
- Stolen code. (He has admitted to it.) [Proof](https://i.gyazo.com/257a7f0657a24acdff7b693197ff61dd.png)

# Replacements for Franc1sco
- csgo.tokenstash.com he is 100% working with these guys, use [csgotokens](https://csgotokens.com), its cheaper, better support & more options (auto restart & more...)
- WS, Knife & Gloves. Well he stole most of his code from the public, regularly updated plugin created by kgns (nice guy btw). [Better WS & Knife](https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=298770), [Better Gloves](https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=299977)
- He tried to make his own steam invite bot at first, ended up stealing this code later on from [Better Steam Invite](https://forums.alliedmods.net/showthread.php?t=301755), also Arkarr is a really nice guy, helped me out a lot for free.

# Franc1sco unethical scare tactics
- He claims all other plugins what provide a similar thing might give you viruses.
- All other plugins will result in a GSLT ban.
- He doesn't clearly state the ws plugin doesn't come with !knife. But after purchase the private repository clearly says "If you want a !knife plugin you need to use the private knife version, if you still dont have it, then buy it from me (Franc1sco franug)."
